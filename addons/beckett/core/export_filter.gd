extends EditorExportPlugin

## Keeps Beckett out of your shipped game.
##
## Beckett is an editor tool, but two things pull it into exports anyway: the
## plugin registers a project autoload (baked into project.godot, and therefore
## into every preset), and Godot's default export filter is "all resources in the
## project", which sweeps up all of addons/. Left alone that ships ~480 KB of
## compiled editor-only GDScript (the dock panel, the MCP server, every tool
## module) that a game can never load.
##
## This runs at export time and skip()s every Beckett file except the autoload
## stub, which has to stay because project.binary names it. The stub is inert
## outside the editor (see runtime/beckett_autoload.gd), so the net effect is a
## pack with no Beckett in it.
##
## Doing it here rather than by writing exclude_filter into the user's
## export_presets.cfg means it needs no setup, covers every preset including ones
## added later, works the same in CI, and never edits a file we do not own.
##
## Opt out with project setting beckett/strip_from_exports = false.

const ADDON_PREFIX := "res://addons/beckett/"
const SETTING := "beckett/strip_from_exports"

## The one file that must survive: project.binary's autoload/BeckettRuntime points
## at it, and an autoload whose script is missing from the pack is a hard error on
## every boot, which is precisely the noise this plugin exists to remove.
