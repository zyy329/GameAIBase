class_name BeckettHelpTools

## `help` (v1.14) — the other half of every tool's docs, served on demand.
##
## Why this tool exists: a tool's description ships on EVERY tools/list, to every client,
## at every effort tier, forever. v1.13.0's `doctor` context block measured what that costs;
## the fat descriptions were 14.7 KB of the 31.9 KB total, and most of those bytes were
## catalogues — the enumeration of `simulate_input`'s event types, `playtest`'s assert
## grammar, `time_control`'s per-frame input shape. A catalogue is what you read ONCE, when
## you are about to use the thing. So the short description names the capability (the model
## still has to learn it exists from tools/list, and nothing else can teach it that), and
## the catalogue moves here, one call away.
##
## Deliberately NOT a skill pack: `pack.ps1` trims addons/beckett/skills out of Lite
## entirely, so a catalogue parked in a pack would vanish for every free user. The long form
## has to live in the registry beside the tool it documents.
##
## L1, like `doctor` — a capped surface has to be able to explain itself at any tier.

A catalogue is read once, when you are about to use the thing. So the description names the CAPABILITY — enough for you to know the tool can do the job — and the syntax lives here. Ask before writing a call you are unsure of; it is one round trip and it costs nothing when you do not.\n\nA tool with no long form falls back to its own description, so this is never a dead end. An unknown name comes back as a normal tool result with a did-you-mean, never as a protocol error.\n\nIt answers for tools ABOVE the current effort tier too, and says so — that is how you find out what raising the dock's AI Effort dial would actually buy you.",
